Watch me code in Haskell for 25 days straight

## Personnal Feedback

### [Day 01](./Day_01)
As usual, day 1 is pretty simple, so I took some time to just write some script
to autogenerate everything I need to start working.

I do have a small complain about that day: part 2 is a bit unclear on the
"oneight" problem (basically: this is "18" and not "1ight")

### [Day 02](./Day_02)
Simple day, the hardest part was parsing the input.

Well the actual hardest part was importing and learning how to use the regex module but whatever <:)

### [Day 03](./Day_03)
Repeat after me: manipulating 2D grids in Haskell is not fun.

I spent like 40 minutes on parsing the input... üòø

### [Day 04](./Day_04)
Was fun üò∏

### [Day 05](./Day_05)
Challenging enough to make me take out a pen and paper, simple enough to make me solve it
