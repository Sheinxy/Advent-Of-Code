Watch me code in Haskell for 25 days straight

## Personnal Feedback

### [Day 01](./Day_01)
As usual, day 1 is pretty simple, so I took some time to just write some script
to autogenerate everything I need to start working.

I do have a small complain about that day: part 2 is a bit unclear on the
"oneight" problem (basically: this is "18" and not "1ight")

### [Day 02](./Day_02)
Simple day, the hardest part was parsing the input.

Well the actual hardest part was importing and learning how to use the regex module but whatever <:)

### [Day 03](./Day_03)
Repeat after me: manipulating 2D grids in Haskell is not fun.

I spent like 40 minutes on parsing the input... 😿

### [Day 04](./Day_04)
Was fun 😸

### [Day 05](./Day_05)
Challenging enough to make me take out a pen and paper, simple enough to make me solve it

### [Day 06](./Day_06)
I am now convinced that odd days are hard and even days are easy.

This is just simple maths!

### [Day 07](./Day_07)
Not too hard, so I decided to have fun with Instances!

### [Day 08](./Day_08)
I hated that I took a wild guess for part 2

### [Day 09](./Day_09)
This was probably the easiest one so far

### [Day 10](./Day_10)
I overcomplicated things once again

### [Day 11](./Day_11)
Well that was easy :)

### [Day 12](./Day_12)
What do you do when your bruteforce solution is too inefficient? YOU DO MEMOIZATION! :D

### [Day 13](./Day_13)
Easy peasy lemon squeezie

### [Day 14](./Day_14)
Not a hard day, but I'm a bit ill and I ended up going from an awful solution first before reworking everything.

### [Day 15](./Day_15)
THAT'S IT???

### [Day 16](./Day_16)
Spent 20 minutes debugging. Didn't notice I swapped north and south somewhere.

### [Day 17](./Day_17)
Please lord have mercy on my sould and stop giving me puzzles involving 2D grids.

Also, I was definitely not recoding an A\* or a Dijkstra on the stop. No can do.

### [Day 18](./Day_18)
This is simply computing an area. Nothing more!

### [Day 19](./Day_19)
It took me a while to understand part 2 (thank you Adam for your explanation)

### [Day 20](./Day_20)
I am once again asking you to analyse the input and make random assumptions.

### [Day 21](./Day_21)
Stop making me analyse the input :)

### [Day 22](./Day_22)
Problems in 3 dimensions usually scare me. But it turns out this one barely makes use of its third dimension, so all is well :D
