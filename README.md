# Advent Of Code
I love Haskell <3

## Disclaimer

I am not a professional Haskell developper.

## Old stuff 

My solutions from 2020 to 2024 are made to be standalone solutions for each day,
I did not have my own helper library, and I did not package my solutions inside
a neat cabal App.

This is not the fanciest or most professional Haskell code you'll see here,
but it works and I think it's fun!

TL;DR: I'm just having fun, and I hope you'll have fun reading my solutions as
well! <3

Watch me code in Haskell for 5 years straight
